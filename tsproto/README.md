# TsProto &emsp; [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tsproto/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tsproto)
This library implements the TeamSpeak3 protocol.

For a usable library to build clients and bots, you should take a look at
[`tsclientlib`](https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsclientlib), which provides a
convenient interface to this library.

If you are searching for a usable client, [Qint](https://github.com/ReSpeak/Qint)
is a cross-platform TeamSpeak client, which is using this library (more
correctly, it is using `tsclientlib`).

For more info on this project, take a look at the
[tsclientlib README](https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsclientlib).
